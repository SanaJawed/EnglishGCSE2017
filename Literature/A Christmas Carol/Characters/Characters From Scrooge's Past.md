# Characters From Scrooge's Past

## Fan helps to break Scrooge's isolation
- Fan was Scrooge's sister, who was affectionate, loving and full of laughter. The ghost and Scrooge agree that "she had a large heart".
- She had a strong bond with Scrooge - she calls him "Dear, dear brother", and he calls her "quite a woman".
- Fan had asked her father more than once to allow Scrooge to come home. Her excitement shows how important it is for her to spend Christmas with Scrooge.
- Fan is dead by the time the main events of the book take place - this makes the reader pity Scrooge for having lost the sister he once loved.

## Fezziwig is a bussinessman with a generous heart
- Mr Fezziwig was Scrooge's genial, cheerful employer when he was a young apprentice. Fezziwig is used as a contrast to Scrooge - but he's a model for the man that Scrooge later becomes.
- Fezziwig makes his warehouse "snug, and warm, and dry, and bright" for a Christmas party for family and workers. This contrasts with Scrooge's mean, dark office when he's an employer himself.
- Fezziwig and his wife dance vigorously at the part. He's a jovial, energetic figure.
- Fezziwig has the power to render people's lives good or bad, and he chooses to make them good. He doesn't spend lots of money on the party, but what he does spend is used to bring joy to others, which creates a great deal of happiness. Scrooge realises this, and begins to do the same with his own life.

## Belle tells Scrooge some hard truths
- Belle was Scrooge's beautiful, wise fiancee. She releases Scrooge from their engagement because she sees that Scrooge has began to love money more than her.
- She's poor and knows that Scrooge, who weighs "everything by Gain", has become reluctant to marry her.
- This separation is a turning point in Scrooge's life. Belle ends up with a family and a home, which, despite being "not very large or handsome", is "full of comfort". In contrast, Scrooge chooses a lonely life devoted to money.
