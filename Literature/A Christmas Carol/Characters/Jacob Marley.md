# Jacob Marley

## Marley's ghost has come to warn Scrooge
- Marley's main role in the novel is to warn Scrooge about what will happen after he dies - unless he changes.
- Marley and Scrooge have similar personalities - they're "two kindred spirits", who are obsessed with money and don't care about other people. They are so similar that Scrooge lives in Marley's old rooms and even answers to Marley's name - "it was all the same to him". These similarities emphasise Marley's role as a warning figure.
- Marley's punishment is the consequence of a self-centred, "misused" life. Dickens has already shown Scrooge behaving similarly - so Marley's fate illustrates what will happen to Scrooge if he doesn't change.

## Marley's appearance is disturbing
- Scrooge feels "the chilling influence" of Marley's "death-cold eyes" and when the ghost removes the bandage from its head, its "lower jaw dropped down upon its breast" - a horrible image. Marley's terrifying appearance reflects the frightening nature of his message and it makes it seem more important.
- Marley gives off an "infernal" (hellish) atmosphere, and his clothes are "agitated as by the hot vapour from an oven". This description links Marely to ideas of hell and eternal suffering.
- The chain Marley wears is made of money-related objects. It was forged because he cared more about money than people. The chain is particularly disturbing for Scrooge because Marley tells him that he bears a similar chain, but much larger.
- Marely is:
  - terrifying: "the spectre's voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones"
  - exhausted: "I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere"
  - direct: "I am here tonight to warn you"
  
## Marley tries to help Scrooge
- Marley regrets that he didn't change his ways whilst he was alive - it's too late for him to avoid sufferng. All he can do is offer Scrooge the chance to escape the same fate.
- He has stood invisibly at Scrooge's shoulder for "many a day" in the past. He acts as a kind of hellish guardian angel.
- Marley says that his presence now is "a chance and hope" of his own "procuring". This suggests that he's tried (and succeeded) to find a way to help Scrooge and give him a chance to save himself.
- Marley is acting selflessly - he's helping a friend, even though he has no hope of redemption himself.
