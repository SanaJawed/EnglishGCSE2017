# The Ghosts

## The three ghosts are different - but they all help Scrooge
- Dickens characterises the three ghosts very differently, which adds interest and variety to the story. The first ghost is a contradictory figure, who's both strong and gentle at the same time. The second ghost is a cheerful, jolly giant - and in contrast the third ghost is silent and ominous.
- The ghosts exist outside the boundaries of human time, and they show Scrooge the visions of the past, present and future. This gives the novella a magical, dream-like mood.
- Scrooge learns from each of his encounters with the ghosts. They make him realise what the impact and consequences of his past and present behaviour could be.

## The Ghost of Christmas Past represents memory and truth
- The Ghost of Christmas Past's appearance is a strange mixture of child-like and aged. It's connected, through Scrooge's memory, to different stages of Scrooge's life.
- A "bright, clear jet of light" shines from its head - this light could symbolise the truth that can be found in memories.
- The ghost is strong but quiet. Its voice is "low" as if "it were at a distance" - like it's speaking to Scrooge from somewhere far away, or long ago. This emphasises the spirit's connection to Scrooge's distant past.
- The ghost helps the reader sympathise with Scrooge by showing us that parts of his childhood were miserable, and that he wasn't always so cold and unfeeling.

## The first spirit is forceful to help Scrooge change
- The spirit makes Scrooge explain the things that he realises when he sees the visions of his past. For example its insistent questions ("What is the matter?... Something, I think?") force Scrooge to explain what he's realised after Fezziwig's party - that sometimes it's important to spend money generously, because of the happiness it gives to others.
- The memory of Belle is "torture" for Scrooge - he begs the ghost to let him leave, but the spirit is too strong for him - it "pinioned him in both his arms" and "forced" him to watch. The ghost's actions seem cruel, but its actions help Scrooge to learn.
- The Ghost of Christmas Past is:
  - forceful: "But the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms, and forced him to observe"
  - questioning: "Is that so much that he deserves this praise?"
  - mysterious: "It was a strange figure"
  
## The Ghost of Christmas Present generously helps others
- The Ghost of Christmas Present is compassionate. It sprinkles incense and water from its torch as a blessing, and it restores the "good humour" of angry people so that they can enjoy Christmas.
- The ghost is closely associated with abundance and generosity. For example, the torch the spirit carries resembles "Plenty's horn" (a symbol of abundance from the Greek and Roman mythology) and it generously sprinkles blessings from it on those who need it most.
- Its scabbard has no sword in it, and it's rusted - suggesting that Christmas should be a time for peace, not fighting other people.
- The Ghost of Christmas Present is:
  - jolly: "there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to see"
  - friendly: "Come in! and know me better, man!"
  - severe: "Slander those who tell it ye!"
  
## The second ghost is upset about poverty
- The Ghost of Christmas Present has "sympathy, with all poor men", and is "sorrowful" at the sight of Ignorance and Want. The spirit cares about the poor and it challenges Scrooge's previous harsh words about poverty - calling them "wicked"
- The spirit speaks emotionally about the way that society ignores the problem of poverty. It argues that society denies the problems of ignorance and want, and suggests that ignoring these problems will eventually lead to society's "Doom".

## The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is a sinister figure
- The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come represents Scrooge's future. The ghost is "shrouded in a deep black garment" - its mysterious appearance implies that the future cannot be known for sure. (Also similar in appearance to the Grim Reaper)
- The ghost is silent and intimidating. It points instead of speaking, and won't answer Scrooge's questions. This adds to the sense of mystery surrounding it.
- It's only when Scrooge begins to beg that the ghost shows any kind of reaction at all - its "kind hand trembled". This could suggest that the ghost pities Scrooge, reminding the reader that the ghosts are trying to help him.
- The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is:
  - frightening: "Scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him"
  - mysterious: "it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery"
  - resolute: "the Spirit did not stay for anything"
