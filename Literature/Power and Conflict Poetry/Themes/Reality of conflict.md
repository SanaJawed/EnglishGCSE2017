# Reality of conflict

## Overview
- Poems set in the heat of the battle create vivid images of what the soldiers are experiencing.
- Poems set after a battle are more detached from the reality

### Horror of war as it happens
- #### Exposure
    - Bleak imagery is used to show the pain the men are in, the description of the frost is a example of this "puckering foreheads crisp". This forces the reader to imageing their flesh freezing.
    - Also the comparison of the wind to the "twitching agonies of men" creates a vivid picture of the condition the men are in.
    - The reality of war throws out all patriotism and heroism, the men "cringe in the holes" like scared animals.
    - Rehitorical questions "what are we doing here?" emphasises the pointlessness of their suffering.
    - The hopeless tone of the poem also sugges that the men belive they have a little chance of survival, they have also seem to accepted that they will never visit their family or friends again.

- #### Bayonet Charge
    - The solider is presented as being a confused and helpless victim, he is "running" in bewilderment. Verbs like "stumbling" suggest he has no control of his situation or actions.
    - His disconfort is clear from his "raw-seamed hot khaki" and the way he "lugged" his rifle.
    - The violent imagery "Bullets smacking the belly out the air" suggest that he may be in pain.

### Horror of war after it happened
- #### The Charge of the Light Brigade
    - The poem creates a noisy and frightening picture of the battle for the reader through the use of onomatopoeia "thunder'd", violent verbs "falsh'd".
    - A relentness, galloping rhythm is used this emphasises the men's bravery.
    - There is a distance between the speaker and the battlefield, the battle is recounted like a story and the chronological structure helps impose a order on the events.

- #### Remains
    - Ware forces people to make morally complicated decisions in the spur of the moment. The solider is left with a disturbing feeling of responsibility, this is shown by the phrase "his bloody life in my bloody hands".
    - Graphic images presents the reader with vivid images of the reality of conflict, the speaker describes seeing "broad daylight" through the bullet holes in the looter, which leave the reader with a disturbing image.
    - The soldier is unable to remain detached for what he has done, his sleep is interrupted by repeated images of the man being "torn apart".
