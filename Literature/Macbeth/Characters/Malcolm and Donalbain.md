# Malcolm and Donalbain

They are Duncan's sons. Malcolm is the eldest, and Duncan makes him his heir. This means that he should be the next King of Scotland, not Macbeth.

## They learn from their father's mistakes
- Malcolm is fair and honest, like his father. However, unlike Duncan, Malcolm and Donalbain are aware that they're in danger from those closest to them: "There's daggers in men's smiles, the near'r in blood / The nearer the bloody" They have common sense to flee Scotland after Duncan is murdered.
- Malcolm learns that he should only trust people who have proved their loyalty - when Macduff visits him, Malcolm tests his loyalty by pretending to be a tyrand. He knows that even people who see good can be evil - "all things foul would wear the brows of grace"
- In the end, Malcolm and Macduff make a good partnership because Macduff's experience gives Malcolm the confidence to take action

## Malcolm and Donalbain aren't impulsive
- They don't react instantly to their father's murder. Malcolm say ther sorrow is too "strong" to act immediately. It shows he's sensible unlike Macbeth.

## Malcolm develops to be a good leader
- He becomes confident, and earns the trust of the Scottish thanes, who say they will "give obedience where 'tis truly owed". They follow Malcolm because he's the rightful King.
- He proves he's clever when he returns to Scotland by hiding the soldiers with trees. He leads them to victory, proving he is a strong leader.
- He rewards everyone who fought with him, like Duncan he's generous.
