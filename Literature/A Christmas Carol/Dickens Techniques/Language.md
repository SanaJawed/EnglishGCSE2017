# Language

## The narrator's language controls the tone 
- At first, the narrator's chatty language creates a lively and engaging tone — he describes Scrooge's house as looking out of place, as if it had got lost whilst "playing at hide-and-seek with other houses".
- The narrator is also sarcastic — he refers to Scrooge as an "excellent man of business" on the day of Marley's funeral, which he arranged for an "undoubted bargain". 
- However, as the story progresses, the narrator's tone becomes more melancholy — Scrooge's school yaid is described as being so silent, that there wasn't even "a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar".
- By Chapter Four, the sarcasm also becomes darker in tone — the desolate graveyard where Scrooge is buried is described as "A worthy place!"
- In the final chapter, the narrator is lighthearted again making the overall mood of the story joyful and uplifting. The chapter is full of exclamations like "Dear heart alive" and "Oh, glorious, glorious!" 

## Personification adds to the text's mood 
- Dickens uses personification to bring the novel's settings to life — a "gruff old bell" is described as "peeping slily" down at Scrooge. Later, the onions in the grocers' shops appear "ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed" as they sit "winking from their shelves". These playful examples of personification make the city seem exciting and alive, and reflect the energy surrounding Christmas.
- At other times, personification is used to reinforce what's being described — in the second chapter, the joyful atmosphere is highlighted by the way the "crisp air laughed" as the boys shout to each other. 
- Personification isn't just used to describe objects — it can be used to give human form to abstract conce The personification of "Ignorance" and "Want" as ragged, desperate children is a good example of this. 

## The mood becomes darker to emphasises Dickens's message 
- The overriding mood of A Christmas Carol is jolly and festive. However, Dickens creates a darker mood. hen he wants to highlight the message of social responsibility that he's putting across in the novel.
  - Marley's appearance is disturbing to focus the reader on the message that he's giving to Scrooge.
  - Dickens depicts Ignorance and Want as frightening, miserable children to draw attention to the major problems that he saw in society.
  - Dickens powerfully describes the area around Joe's shop to present his reader with a realistic, harsh vision of poverty in London - "the whole quarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery"
  
  ## Dickens gives clear, vivid descriptions
  - Dickens uses several techniques in his descriptions to help create clear in the reader's mind and emphasise a particular mood in the text. 
    - Repeated phrases and lists help to exaggerate the sense of celebration that surrounds Christmas. Each guest at Fezziwig's party is introduced with the phrase "In came". Their attitude as they enter is also shown by a list — "some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling". This repetition gives the sense of a bustling room full of lots of people, noise and movement.
    - Often long sentances are used to list lots of items — for example in the description of the scene in which the Ghost of Christmas Present first appears. This quickens the pace of the text and creates an atmosphere of excitement — its as if the narrator is overwhelmed by the abundance he's describing.
    - Dickens uses the five senses to make his descriptions vivid and engaging. For example, the scene where the Ghost of Christmas Present appears is brought to life by the "bright gleaming berries", the "delicious steam" coming from the punch, the "roaring" blaze of the fire and the spirit's "cheery voice". 
  - The novel also contains vivid negative descriptions, for example:
    - The sinister graveyard of Scrooge's future burial is described as "fat with repleted appetite", as if it's gorged on dead bodies.
    - Scrooge's old schoolroom is empty and silent, without even "a squeak and scuffle from the mice" or "a drip from the half-thawed water-spout".
- Sometimes, Dickens deliberately doesn't describe something to let the reader use their imagination. In Chapter One, he refers to the ghosts' "incoherent sounds of lamentation" and "wailings inexpressibly sorrowful". Dickens's lack of description makes the passage more haunting — its as if the noise is so awful that its impossible to describe fully. 

## Figurative language creates powerful descriptions
- Dickens uses similes to create a comic and lighthearted mood. Even a sinister image like Marley's chain is softened by a humorous simile — it "wound about him like a tail". 
- However, there are other more sombre examples of figurative language in the text, such as the metaphor used in the description of the fog as being so dense that "the houses opposite were mere phantoms".
- Dickens often uses hyperboles (exaggeration) to make his descriptions more entrain .The Cratchits react as if their goose is "the rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of course", demonstrating how much they appreciate their meagre Christmas dinner.


## Dialogue creates different moods
Dickens uses a lot of dialogue in A Christmas Carol to reveal various characters' thoughts and feelings. He also describes the speakers' manner and body language.
- Belle speaks "gently", but honestly. Her tears and her caring language reveal that Scrooge was on, loved. She tells Scrooge she's leaving him "With a full heart, for the love of him you once were", Belle's soft, sad words make the reader feel sorry for Scrooge that he's lost her love due to his own greed.
- Dickens contrasts the kind-hearted dialogue of the charity collectors with Scrooge's uncaring response The charity collectors find it "more than usually desirable" to provide some "slight provision for the poor and destitute". Scrooge says that if the poor "would rather die... they had better do it".
- There's a contrast in Cratchits' dialogue as the tone of their conversation changes. Before Tiny Tim's death, their conversations are littered with enthusiastic exclamations like "Hurrah!" and "Lord bless ye!" But afterwards, their language is sombre — their dialogue seems much quieter and hesitant. 

## Questions help the reader to engage with the text 
- Dickens often uses questions to engage the reader. At the start of the text, the narrator asks, "Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did." This gives the impression of a conversation  with the reader — it's as if he's answering their questions.
- he narrator also asks questions and leaves them unanswered — when Scrooge sees people from his childhood celebrating Christmas, the narrator asks "What was merry Christmas to Scrooge?... What good had it ever done to him?" These questions make the reader think about what Scrooge might have been like once.
- Dickens also uses questions to show how Scrooge is changing: 
  - The Ghost of Christmas Past tries to get Scrooge to say what he's feeling by asking questions like "Wha is the matter?" and "Something, I think?" The ghost is trying to draw the emotions out of Scrooge. 
  - The Ghost of Christmas Present asks Scrooge questions that force him to think about his attitude — "Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die?" Scrooge also asks questions, which shows his willingness to learn — "Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch?" 
  - The last ghost doesn't speak, so Scrooge is left to ask all the questions. At the end of the chapter, he frantically asks the ghost "Are these the shadows of the things that Will be". He doesn't receive any answers, but his questions reveal that he's determined to change his ways. 
- Although the ghosts' questions are directed at Scrooge, they're also designed to make the reader think about their own attitude, and whether they should take more responsibility for those around them.
