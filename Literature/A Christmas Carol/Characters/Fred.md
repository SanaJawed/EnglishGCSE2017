# Fred

## Fred is a complete contrast to Scrooge
- Fred arrives in Scrooge's offices "all in a glow" and "his eyes sparkled" - this emphasises the warmth and friendliness of his character. He's the opposite of Scrooge, who is associated with the cold and dark.
- Fred disagrees with Scrooge's miserly values. He thinks that Scrooge's wealth is useless because "he don't do any good with it" - suggesting that, unlike Scrooge, he values happiness more than money.
- He's empathetic - he's "heartily sorry" for the Cratchit family after Tim dies, even though he barely knows them. This contrasts with Scrooge who begins the novella as a self-centred person who doesn't care about others.
- Dickens uses Fred as a foil to Scrooge's character. The differences between them emphasise Scrooge's negative qualities.

## Fred is a cheerful man
- Fred's personality is defined by his destinctive and pleasant laugh. The narrator says he'd like to meet "a man more blest in a laugh than Scrooge's nephew". Fred illustrates his cheerfulness and optimism.
- He's even-tempered and refuses to argue with Scrooge. He tells Scrooge "I'll keep my Christmans humour to the last" and later says that he "couldn't be angry" with Scrooge even if he tried.
- Fred shows insight when he says that Scrooge's "offences carry their own punishment" - he understands that by refusing to embrace his family, Scrooge is only hurting himself.
- He's determined to include Scrooge in the celebrations: "I mean to give him the same chance, every year, whether he likes it or not". He believes in the importance of being kind at Christmas, especially to family.

## Fred shows true Christmas spirit
- Dickens presents Fred as someone who shows lots of the values associated with Christmas and the Christmas spirit.
- Fred shows generosity to Scrooge in inviting him to his party, and forgiveness when he welcomes Scrooge into his home, despite Scrooge's behaviour - "It is a mercy he didn't shake his arm off"
- Fred also knows how to have fun - his Christmas party is an enjoyable ocassion, which is filled with games and laughter.
- Fred is:
  - jovial: "Scrooge's nephew revelled in another laugh"
  - enthusiastic: "A merry Christmas uncle! God save you!"
  - caring: "Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr Scrooge's nephew"
