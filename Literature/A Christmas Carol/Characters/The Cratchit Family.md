# The Cratchit Family

## The Cratchits are por but loving
- Mr and Mrs Cratchit have six children - Martha, Peter, Belinda, two "smaller Cratchits" and Tiny Tim. Except for Martha, they all live in the same four-roomed house. They're loving and cheerful despite their poverty.
- Dicken's depiction of the Cratchits reminds the reader that poor people are not just a social problem - they're individuals and families who share joys, loves, sorrows and fears like anyone else.

## Bob Cratchit is Scrooge's empoyee
- As Scrooge's clerk, Bob is uncomplaining and tolerant. He works quietly in his "dismal little cell" of an office despite the bitter cold.
- He's courteous and deferential - he returns Fred's greetings "cordially" and addresses Scrooge as "sir".
- Bob is patient when Scrooge grumbles about his taking Christmas day off. Bob remains civil despite Scrooge's continually grumpy attitude.
- His eagerness and pleasure regarding Christmas, contrast with Scrooge's attitude. Bob can't help applauding Fred's speech about the joy of Christmas - which contrasts with Scrooge's grumpy response - "Humbug!"

## He is also a kind and devoted father
- Bob is a good-humoured, playful father. He carries Tiny Tim home from the Christmas church service on his shoulders, and on his way home on Christmas Eve, he takes twenty turns sliding down an icy street - despite having no coat.
- When he thinks Martha isn't joining the family for Christmas, he's upset. He hugs her "to his heart's content" when she appears. It's important to him to have all his family together at Christmas.
- He's caring and tender with Tiny Tim, who site "very close to his father's side" while Bob holds his hand.
- Despite his grief at Tim's death, he tries to be cheerful around his family, in order to spare them more pain - "'I am very happy', said little Bob."
- Bob Cratchit is:
  - cheerful: "Bob was very cheerful with them"
  - loving: "Bob... hugged his daughter to his heart's content"
  - forgiving: "Mr Scrooge, the Founder of the Feast!"
  
## Mrs Cratchit is good-natured and busy
- Mrs Cratchit works hard to make the Cratchit family happy. The Christmas goose has to be "eked out" to feed the whole family, but the Cratchits greet the food with "universal admiration".
- Although she thinks Scrooge is an "odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man", she still drinks to his health, because Bob wants her to and she loves him.
- When Tim dies she's protective of her family's feelings. She speaks in a "steady, cheerful voice" and hides her "weak eyes" from Bob - she doesn't want to add to his worries.

## Tiny Tim is frail - but he doesn't complain
- Tiny Tim is fragile and very ill. His father carries him on his shoulders and is especially close to him, whilst Tim's siblings make sure he joins in on all the fun.
- Dickens presents Tiny Tim as a good character by showing us his religious nature. Tim hopes people see him in church, because he wants to remind people about "who made lame beggars walk". He also echoes his father's toast - "God bless us every one!"
- Dickens also uses Tim to show us how poverty can lead to suffering and death. If Scrooge hadn't helped the Cratchits, Tiny Tim would've died.

## The Cratchit children are hard-working
- Peter is Bob's "son and heir". He likes the idea of being rich and upper class - he proudly wears Bob's "shirt collar" and "yearned to show his linen in the fashionable Parks".
- Bob is keen for Peter to start working as a "man of business", while Martha words hard as a milliner's apprentice (making hats). Dickens emphasises that the Cratchit children aren't lazy or unwilling to work, to challenge the beliefs of thos ewho thought that poverty was often linked to laziness.
- The Cratchits all help out with the Christmas dinner, even the youngest children - they work together as a family.
- The young Cratchits are excitable - they "crammed spoons into their mouths, lest they should shriek for goose". Their excitement adds to the positivity of the Cratchit household.
